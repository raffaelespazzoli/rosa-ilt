== Introduction
// To be updated using something else but GitHub. E.g. Gitea.
OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions. Some key features of OpenShift Pipelines include:

* OpenShift Pipelines is a serverless CI/CD system that runs Pipelines with all the required dependencies in isolated containers.
* OpenShift Pipelines are designed for decentralized teams that work on microservice-based architecture.
* OpenShift Pipelines use standard CI/CD pipeline definitions that are easy to extend and integrate with the existing Kubernetes tools, enabling you to scale on-demand.
* You can use OpenShift Pipelines to build images with Kubernetes tools such as Source-to-Image (S2I), Buildah, Buildpacks, and Kaniko that are portable across any Kubernetes platform.
* You can use the OpenShift Container Platform Developer Console to create Tekton resources, view logs of Pipeline runs, and manage pipelines in your OpenShift Container Platform namespaces.

== Install the OpenShift Pipelines operator

[WARNING]
====
*GitHub Account Required*

This section of the workshop requires a personal https://github.com[GitHub] account. If you do not have a GitHub account and do not wish to create one, you can skip this section and move to the next section.
====

. Return to your tab with the OpenShift Web Console.
. Using the menu on the left select *Operator \-> OperatorHub*.
+

== Configure the GitHub integration

. In your web browser, go to the following GitHub repositories:
 ** https://github.com/rh-mobb/common-java-dependencies
 ** https://github.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-app

. Ensure you are logged in to GitHub and select the _Fork_ button for *both* repositories and then choose your own GitHub account.
+
image::../media/github-fork.png[GitHub Repository Fork]

. Next, browse to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new GitHub Personal Access Token.
Use *rosa-workshop* for the Name, set the *Expiration* to `7 Days` and the *Scope* to "repo" and click _Generate Token_.
+
image::../media/github-personal-access-token.png[GitHub Personal Access Token]
+
[WARNING]
====
*Do not* forget to delete this token once the workshop is over.
====

. Next, save the token to your cloud bastion host.
To do so, run the following command, ensuring you replace the `replaceme` with your Personal Access Token:
+
[source,sh]
----
export GH_TOKEN=replaceme
----

. Then, save your GitHub username as a variable.
To do so, run the following command, ensuring you replace the `replaceme` with your GitHub username.
+
[source,sh]
----
export GH_USER=replaceme
----

. Next, we'll create a new working directory to clone our forked GitHub repositories.
To do so, run the following commands:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
mkdir ~/gitops

cd ~/gitops

git clone https://github.com/${GH_USER}/common-java-dependencies.git

git clone https://github.com/${GH_USER}/rosa-workshop-app.git
----

== Import tasks to our pipeline

The next thing we need to do is import common tasks that our pipeline will use.
These common tasks are designed to be reused across multiple pipelines.

. Switch back to the `microsweeper-ex` project from earlier:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc project microsweeper-ex
----

. Let's start by taking a look at the reusable tasks that we will be using.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
ls ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/*.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/1-git-clone.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/2-mvn.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/3-mvn-build-image.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/4-apply-manifest.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/5-update-deployment.yaml
----
+

 ** `1-git-clone.yaml`: Clones a given GitHub Repo.
 ** `2-mvn.yaml`: This Task can be used to run a Maven build
 ** `3-mvn-build-image.yaml`: Packages source with maven builds and into a container image, then pushes it to a container registry.
Builds source into a container image using Project Atomic's Buildah build tool.
It uses Buildah's support for building from Dockerfiles, using its buildah bud command.This command executes the directives in the Dockerfile to assemble a container image, then pushes that image to a container registry.
 ** `4-apply-manifest.yaml`: Applied manifest files to the cluster
 ** `5-update-deployment.yaml`: Updates a deployment with the new container image.

. Next, we need to apply all of these tasks to our cluster.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc apply -n microsweeper-ex -f \
  ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
task.tekton.dev/git-clone created
task.tekton.dev/maven created
task.tekton.dev/build-maven-image created
task.tekton.dev/apply-manifests created
task.tekton.dev/update-deployment created
----

== Configure our pipeline

. Next, create the pipeline service account and permissions that the pipeline tasks will run under.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc create -f ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/1-pipeline-account.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
secret/kube-api-secret created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pipeline-role created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pipeline-role-binding created
----

. We also need to give the pipeline permission for certain privileged security context constraints to that it can execute builds.
To grant these permissions, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z pipeline
oc -n microsweeper-ex adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline
----

. Create a persistent volume claim that the pipeline will use to store build images.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc create -f ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/2-pipeline-pvc.yaml
----

. Next, let's review the pipeline definition.
To do so, open the following link in a new tab: https://github.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-app/blob/main/pipeline/3-pipeline.yaml.
+
Browse through the file and notice all the tasks that are being executed.
These are the tasks we imported in the previous step.
The pipeline definition simply says which order the tasks are run and what parameters should be passed between tasks.

== Update Application Settings

. Now that we have the source code forked, we need to copy the properties file we created in the previous section to our new code base.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cp ~/rosa-workshop-app/src/main/resources/application.properties \
   ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/src/main/resources/application.properties
----

. Next, let's configure our Git CLI.
To do so, run the following commands:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
git config --global user.email "${GH_USER}@github.io"
git config --global user.name "${GH_USER}"
----

. Finally, let's commit our changes to GitHub.
To do so, run the following set of commands:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cd ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app

git remote set-url origin https://${GH_USER}:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/${GH_USER}/rosa-workshop-app

git add .

git commit -am "Update Properties File"

git push
----

. In addition, let's go ahead and create a secret with our GitHub credentials that we will need later.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: gitsecret
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: https://github.com
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: ${GH_USER}
  secretToken: ${GH_TOKEN}
EOF
----

. Now let's proceed with creating our pipeline definition.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc create -f ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/3-pipeline.yaml
----

. Finally, we will create a pipeline run that will execute the pipeline, pull the code from your forked GitHub repositories, build the image, and deploy it to ROSA.
To do this, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: minesweeper-pipeline-
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: maven-pipeline
  serviceAccountName: pipeline
  params:
  - name: application-name
    value: microsweeper-appservice
  - name: dependency-git-url
    value: https://github.com/${GH_USER}/common-java-dependencies
  - name: application-git-url
    value: https://github.com/${GH_USER}/rosa-workshop-app
  - name: dockerfile-path
    value: src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm
  - name: image-name
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/microsweeper-ex/minesweeper
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: minesweeper-source-pvc
EOF
----

== Validate the pipeline

Let's take a look at the OpenShift Web Console to see what was created and if the application was successfully deployed.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure your Project is set to ``microsweeper-ex``
====

. From the OpenShift Web Console, click on *Pipelines* \-> *Tasks*.
+
image::../media/pipeline-tasks-ocp.png[Image]
+
Notice the 5 tasks that we imported and click into them to view the YAML definitions.

. Next, lets look at the Pipeline.
Click on *Pipelines*.
Notice that it is either still running, or the last run was successful.
Click on _maven-pipeline_ to view the pipeline details.
+
image::../media/pipeline-ocp.png[Image]

. On the following screen, click on *PipelineRuns* to view the status of each Pipeline Run.
+
image::../media/pipeline-run-ocp.png[Image]

. Lastly, click on the *PipelineRun* name and you can see all the details and steps of the pipeline.
If your are curious, you can also view the logs of the different tasks that were run.
+
image::../media/pipeline-run-details-ocp.png[Image]

. Watch the PipelineRun page as the tasks complete and the PipelineRun finishes.

== Event Triggering

At this point, we can successfully build and deploy new code by manually running our pipeline.
But how can we configure the pipeline to run automatically when we commit code to Git?
We can do so with an Event Listener and a Trigger.

. Let's start by looking at the resources we will be creating to create our event listener and trigger.
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
ls ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/*.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/1-web-trigger-binding.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/2-web-trigger-template.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/3-web-trigger.yaml
/home/rosa/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/4-event-listener.yaml
----

. Take a look at the files listed:

** `1-web-trigger-binding.yaml` This TriggerBinding allows you to extract fields, such as the git repository name, git commit number, and the git repository URL in this case.
To learn more about TriggerBindings, click https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/triggerbindings/[here]

** `2-web-trigger-template.yaml` The TriggerTemplate specifies how the pipeline should be run.
Browsing the file above, you will see there is a definition of the PipelineRun that looks exactly like the PipelineRun you create in the previous step.
This is by design!
...
it should be the same.
+
To learn more about TriggerTemplates, https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/triggertemplates/[review the Tekton documentation].
 
** `3-web-trigger.yaml` The next file we have is the Trigger.
The Trigger specifies what should happen when the EventListener detects an Event.
Looking at this file, you will see that we are looking for 'Push' events that will create an instance of the TriggerTemplate that we just created.
This in turn will start the PipelineRun.
+
To learn more about Triggers, https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/triggers/[review the Tekton documentation].

** `4-event-listenter.yaml` The last file we have is the Event Listener.
An EventListener is a Kubernetes object that listens for events at a specified port on your OpenShift cluster.
It exposes an OpenShift Route that receives incoming event and specifies one or more Triggers.
+
To learn more about EventListeners, https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/eventlisteners/[review the Tekton documentation].

. Next, let's update our web trigger template with your GitHub username.
To do this, let's run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
sed -i "s/GITHUB_USER_ID/${GH_USER}/g" \
  ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/2-web-trigger-template.yaml
----

. Now that you have reviewed all the files, let's apply them to our cluster.
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex create -f \
  ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener
----
+
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
triggerbinding.triggers.tekton.dev/minesweeper-trigger-binding created
triggertemplate.triggers.tekton.dev/minesweeper-trigger-template created
trigger.triggers.tekton.dev/minesweeper-trigger created
eventlistener.triggers.tekton.dev/minesweeper-el created
----

. Before we test out our EventListener and Trigger, lets review what was created in OpenShift.

. From the OpenShift console, under Pipelines, click on Triggers.
. Browse the EventListener, TriggerTemplate and TriggerBindings that you just created.
image:../media/ocp-triggers.png[Image]
+
The next thing we need to do, is connect our EventListener with Git.
When an action, such as a git push, happens, git will need to call our EventListener to start the build and deploy process.

. First we need to do is expose our EventListener service to the internet.
To do so, we'll run the `oc expose` command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex expose svc el-minesweeper-el
----

. To get the URL of the Event Listener Route that we just created, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex get route el-minesweeper-el \
   -o jsonpath="http://{.spec.host}{'\n'}"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
http://el-minesweeper-el-microsweeper-ex.apps.rosa-8wqxv.1yyt.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. The last step we need to do, is configure GitHub to call this event listener URL when events occur.
+
From your browser, go to your personal GitHub rosa-workshop-app repository, and click on *Settings*.
+
image:../media/git-settings.png[Image]

. On the next screen, click on *Webhooks*.
+
image:../media/git-settings-webhook.png[Image]

. Click on the *Add Webhook* button.
+
image:../media/git-add-webhook.png[Image]

. On the next screen, enter the following settings:

* *PayloadURL* - enter the URL you got above (for example: `+http://el-minesweeper-el-microsweeper-ex.apps.rosa-8wqxv.1yyt.p1.openshiftapps.com+`)
* *ContentType* - select application/json
* *Secret* - this your GitHub Personal Access Token (`echo $GH_TOKEN`)
+
Where does the secret value come from?
Refer to the `~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app/pipeline/tasks/event-listener/3-web-trigger.yaml` file.
+
You will see the following snippet that contains the secret to access git.
+
[source,yaml]
----
  interceptors:
    - ref:
        name: "github"
      params:
        - name: "secretRef"
          value:
            secretName: gitsecret
            secretKey: secretToken
        - name: "eventTypes"
          value: ["push"]
----
+
The secret you enter here for the git webhook, needs to match the value for the *secretToken* key of the a secret named gitsecret.
If you remember in the previous step, we created this secret and used your git token as this value.

. Keep the remaining defaults, and click _Add webhook_.
+
image::../media/add-webhook.png[Image]

=== Test the Event Triggering

Now that we have our trigger, eventlistener and git webhook setup, lets test it out.

. Make sure you are in the directory for your personal git repo where the application is, and edit the `./src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html` file.

. Search for Leaderboard and change it to <YOUR NAME> Leaderboard.
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cd ~/gitops/rosa-workshop-app
vim src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html
----
+
image::../media/html-edit.png[Image]

. Now commit and push the change:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
git commit -am 'Updated leaderboard title'
git push
----

. Pushing the change to the your git repository will kick of the event listener which will start the pipeline.
+
Quickly switch over to your OpenShift Web Console, and watch the pipeline run.
+
image::../media/watch-pipeline.png[Image]

. Once the pipeline finishes, check out the change.
From the OpenShift Web Console, click on _Networking_ \-> _Routes_.
+
image:../media/route-2.png[Image]

. You should see the updated application with a new title for the leaderboard!
+
image:../media/updated-minesweeper.png[Image]

Congratulations! You've successfully installed OpenShift Pipelines and used it to deploy an application.
