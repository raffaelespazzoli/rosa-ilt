== Introduction
Red Hat® OpenShift® GitOps is an operator that provides a workflow that integrates git repositories, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, and Kubernetes to realize faster, more secure, scalable software development, without compromising quality.

OpenShift GitOps enables customers to build and integrate declarative git driven CD workflows directly into their application development platform. 

There's no single tool that converts a development pipeline to "DevOps". By implementing a GitOps framework, updates and changes are pushed through declarative code, automating infrastructure and deployment requirements, and CI/CD.

OpenShift GitOps takes advantage of https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD] and integrates it into Red Hat OpenShift to deliver a consistent, fully supported, declarative Kubernetes platform to configure and use with GitOps principles.

OpenShift and OpenShift GitOps:

* Apply consistency across cluster and deployment lifecycles
* Consolidate administration and management of applications across on-premises and cloud environments
* Check the state of clusters making application constraints known early
* Rollback code changes across clusters
* Roll out new changes submitted via Git

== Deploying your Application with OpenShift GitOps

. From the OpenShift Console Administrator view click through *HOME* \-> *Operators* \-> *Operator Hub*, search for "openshift gitops" and click *Install*.
+
For the update channel select *gitops-1.8*. Leave all other defaults and click *Install*.
+

. Wait until the operator shows as successfully installed (*Installed operator - ready for use*).

. In your bastion VM create a new project:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc new-project bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "bgd" on server "https://api.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. Deploy ArgoCD into your project
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---

kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd

      tls:

        termination: edge
EOF
----

.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
argocd.argoproj.io/argocd created
----

. Wait for ArgoCD to be ready
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server -n bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "argocd-server" successfully rolled out
----

. Apply the GitOps application for your application:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: bgd-app
  namespace: bgd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: bgd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: apps/bgd/base
    repoURL: https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=false
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
application.argoproj.io/bgd-app created
----

. Find the URL for your Argo CD dashboard, copy it to your web browser and log in using your OpenShift credentials (remind yourself what your password for user `admin` is by typing `echo ${COGNITO_ADMIN_PASSWORD}`)
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc get route argocd-server -n bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
argocd-server-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----
+
image::../media/argo_app1.png[]

. Click on the Application to show its topology
+
image::../media/argo_sync.png[]

. Verify that OpenShift sees the Deployment as rolled out
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "bgd" successfully rolled out
----

. Get the route and browse to it in your browser
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc get route bgd -n bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
bgd-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. You should see a green box in the website like so
+
image::../media/bgd_green.png[]

. Patch the OpenShift resource to force it to be out of sync with the github repository:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc -n bgd patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":
  "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"blue"}]'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/bgd patched
----

. Refresh Your browser and you should see a blue box in the website like so
+
image::../media/app_blue.png[]

. Meanwhile check ArgoCD it should show the application as out of sync. Click the *Sync* button and then click on *Synchronize* to have it revert the change you made in OpenShift
+
image::../media/sync_bgd.png[]

. Check again, you should see a green box in the website like so
+
image::../media/bgd_green.png[]

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed OpenShift Gitops
