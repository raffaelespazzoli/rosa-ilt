== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides fully-managed cluster upgrades. The ROSA Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team will monitor and manage all ROSA cluster upgrades. Customers get status emails from the SRE team before, during, and after the upgrade. These updates can be scheduled from the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) or from the ROSA CLI.

During ROSA upgrades, one node is upgraded at a time. This is done to ensure customer applications are not impacted during the update, when deployed in a highly-available and fault-tolerant method.

There are two ways to upgrade a ROSA cluster - using OpenShift Cluster Manager or using the `rosa` CLI. In this lab environment we do not have access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager so we will use the `rosa` CLI.

== Upgrade using the `rosa` command line interface

. Remind yourself of the version of your cluster:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Client Version: 4.13.4
Kustomize Version: v4.5.7
Server Version: 4.13.4
Kubernetes Version: v1.26.3+b404935
----

. Find out the available versions:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
oc adm upgrade
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Cluster version is 4.13.0

Upgradeable=False

  * Kubernetes 1.26 and therefore OpenShift 4.13 remove several APIs which require admin consideration. Please see the knowledge ar
ticle https://access.redhat.com/articles/6958394 for details and instructions.
  * Cluster operator cloud-credential should not be upgraded between minor versions: Upgradeable annotation cloudcredential.openshi
ft.io/upgradeable-to on cloudcredential.operator.openshift.io/cluster object needs updating before upgrade. See Manually Creating I
AM documentation for instructions on preparing a cluster for upgrade.

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: stable-4.12 (available channels: candidate-4.12, candidate-4.13, eus-4.12, fast-4.12, stable-4.12)

Recommended updates:

  VERSION     IMAGE
  4.13.1     quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:db976910d909373b1136261a5479ed18ec08c93971285ff760ce75c6217d3943

[NOTE]
====
Depending on when you run this command the available version list may be longer than just the next release.
====

. You probably don't want to actually upgrade the cluster right now since that may disrupt your lab environment. Luckily it is possible to schedule an update at a less inconvenient time.
+
Get a date and time that is 24 hours from now:
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
export UPGRADE_DATE=$(date -d "+24 hours" '+%Y-%m-%d')
export UPGRADE_TIME=$(date '+%H:%M')

echo Date: ${UPGRADE_DATE}, Time: ${UPGRADE_TIME}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Date: 2023-04-18, Time: 19:51
----

. Now schedule the cluster upgrade to the latest version that is shown in the list of available versions (in the example above that is `4.12.10`) - answer `y` when prompted if you really want to upgrade.
+
[source,sh,role=copy]
----
rosa upgrade cluster \
  -c ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --version 4.13.1 \
  --mode auto \
  --schedule-date ${UPGRADE_DATE} \
  --schedule-time ${UPGRADE_TIME}
----

.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

Congratulations! You've successfully scheduled an upgrade of your cluster for tomorrow at this time. While the workshop environment will be deleted before then, you now have the experience to schedule upgrades in the future.

=== Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade Graph Tool

Occasionally, you may be not be able to go directly from your current version to a desired version. In these cases, you must first upgrade your cluster from your current version, to an intermediary version, and then to your desired version. To help you navigate these decisions, you can take advantage of the https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_path_rosa[Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade Graph Tool].

image:../media/rosa_upgrade_graph.png[ROSA Upgrade Graph Tool Screenshot]{ align=center }

In this scenario to upgrade your cluster from version 4.11.0 to 4.12.15, you must first upgrade to 4.11.39, then you can upgrade to 4.12.15. The ROSA Upgrade Graph Tool helps you easily see which version you should upgrade to.

Here you learned:

* All upgrades are monitored and managed by the ROSA SRE Team
* Use OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) to schedule an upgrade for your ROSA cluster
* Explore the OpenShift Upgrade Graph Tool to see available upgrade paths

== Upgrade using the OpenShift Cluster Manager

[WARNING]
====
This section is for your information only. You do *not* have access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager. Feel free to read through these instructions to understand how to do it via the console - or skip to the next swection.
====

. Log back into the OpenShift Cluster Manager by https://console.redhat.com/openshift[clicking here].
. In the _Clusters_ section, locate your cluster and click on it.
